title: MIT OCW&#58; One Down More To Go

[MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) has the best Computer
Science courses I've taken thus far. I love them, but its taken me a long while
to work through them. I'm busy with other things, from programming project to
playing video games. I don't always put in the time for study that I would like
to.

However, my slow progress has not been no progress. I've learned a lot. I've
learned how necessary it is to break problems into smaller problems and then to
piece them back together. I've learned how to use statistical packages like
`scipy` and `matplotlib` to make charts. I've learned methods of machine
learning like clustering which turn out to be far simpler then I would have
imagined. There has been a ton of growth.

I know I'm not done yet. I still have plenty more to learn. I'm just thankful
that I am learning. Today I finished all of one of the
[MIT courses that I took](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/).
Now I'm moving on to the next MIT course. One step at a time, I'm going to
learn all that I want to learn so that I can be the programmer and statistician
that I desire to be.
