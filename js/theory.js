// Purpose
//
// This is a program that is meant to illustrate the problems with Occam's Razor.
// My goal in writing this is to show how from a theoretical perspective, Occam's 
// Razor does not have of necessity high utility in matters of deciding between 
// truth and falsehood.
//
// My hope is that people who are using it in this manner will be convinced and 
// convincted of their sloppy reasoning, for their own beneift, so that in the 
// future they do not employ Occam's Razor in deciding between claims of truth. 
//
// I'm doing this for the sake of Jesus Christ and his gospel. If there is any 
// merit or good thing that comes of this, then it his own glory and not mine.
// I know that I don't know as I ought to know, that even what I know I only know 
// in part, and that ignorance and err are part of our human condition. I believe 
// that even atheists can understand that those claims apply to both me and them.
// 
// Jesus Christ is Lord and He loves you. I hope you find the code a pleasure to 
// read. Feel free to discuss it with me or give suggestions with regard to editing 
// or style.

// Evidence
//
// The real world is an interesting thing. It is so very complex. Capturing its 
// fullness in a computer program is a bit beyond the scope of this program and 
// my ability. As a result we are going to be making simplifying assumptions 
// which are hopefully, in part, analogous to reality. I do not say that they hold 
// fully to how reality is. Actually, I believe I'm making many assumptions that 
// are not in keeping with how I believe that reality actually works. Nevertheless, 
// in this program it shall be understod that reality is merely a finite list of 
// integers.
// 
// Behold, our reality simplified:

reality = [73, 110, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 98, 101, 103, 105, 110, 110, 105, 110, 103, 32, 71, 111, 100, 32, 99, 114, 101, 97, 116, 101, 100, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 104, 101, 97, 118, 101, 110, 32, 97, 110, 100, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 101, 97, 114, 116, 104, 46, 32, 65, 110, 100, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 101, 97, 114, 116, 104, 32, 119, 97, 115, 32, 119, 105, 116, 104, 111, 117, 116, 32, 102, 111, 114, 109, 44, 32, 97, 110, 100, 32, 118, 111, 105, 100, 59, 32, 97, 110, 100, 32, 100, 97, 114, 107, 110, 101, 115, 115, 32, 119, 97, 115, 32, 117, 112, 111, 110, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 102, 97, 99, 101, 32, 111, 102, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 100, 101, 101, 112, 46, 32, 65, 110, 100, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 83, 112, 105, 114, 105, 116, 32, 111, 102, 32, 71, 111, 100, 32, 109, 111, 118, 101, 100, 32, 117, 112, 111, 110, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 102, 97, 99, 101, 32, 111, 102, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 119, 97, 116, 101, 114, 115, 46, 32, 65, 110, 100, 32, 71, 111, 100, 32, 115, 97, 105, 100, 44, 32, 76, 101, 116, 32, 116, 104, 101, 114, 101, 32, 98, 101, 32, 108, 105, 103, 104, 116, 58, 32, 97, 110, 100, 32, 116, 104, 101, 114, 101, 32, 119, 97, 115, 32, 108, 105, 103, 104, 116, 46, 32, 65, 110, 100, 32, 71, 111, 100, 32, 115, 97, 119, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 108, 105, 103, 104, 116, 44, 32, 116, 104, 97, 116, 32, 105, 116, 32, 119, 97, 115, 32, 103, 111, 111, 100, 58, 32, 97, 110, 100, 32, 71, 111, 100, 32, 100, 105, 118, 105, 100, 101, 100, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 108, 105, 103, 104, 116, 32, 102, 114, 111, 109, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 100, 97, 114, 107, 110, 101, 115, 115, 46, 32, 65, 110, 100, 32, 71, 111, 100, 32, 99, 97, 108, 108, 101, 100, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 108, 105, 103, 104, 116, 32, 68, 97, 121, 44, 32, 97, 110, 100, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 100, 97, 114, 107, 110, 101, 115, 115, 32, 104, 101, 32, 99, 97, 108, 108, 101, 100, 32, 78, 105, 103, 104, 116, 46, 32, 65, 110, 100, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 101, 118, 101, 110, 105, 110, 103, 32, 97, 110, 100, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 109, 111, 114, 110, 105, 110, 103, 32, 119, 101, 114, 101, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 102, 105, 114, 115, 116, 32, 100, 97, 121, 46];


// Theory
// 
// What caused this chain of numbers that we call reality? What brough it about?
// Obviously, I created it, but what function would produce this list? If we were 
// about half-way through the list, how could we predict that one hundred would be 
// followed by thirty-two? There are so many different functions that could potentially 
// produce a list like this one, but I can assert that I know that there was actually 
// only one function. So its kind of like a mystery: how did this chain of numbers come 
// about? Which rules were used to produce it? What would happen next if I were to add 
// to this finite list in accordance with the method that produced it and without deviation 
// from that method?
// 
// And so we must decide between explanations. But in order to do that we need explanations.
// I'll toss out a few which are useless just to get a sense for some of the possibilities. 
// And since we are looking for discriminating explanations to help us differentiate between 
// possible solutions, we will make testable predictions.
//
// Here is an example of a very simple function which makes predictions and which classifies 
// whether those predictions are true or false.

//
// I wouldn't say that these suppositions are particularly good models of how science
