<div class="about-me">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm the CEO, lead engineer, and research scientist at TackTech where I'm working at democratizing optimal strategic reasoning. I'm also a Principal Software Engineer at Walmart.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love hard engineering problems, learning learning, understanding understanding, and thinking about thinking. Previously I worked at Amazon on an Alexa feature experiment platform and before that I worked at Meta doing at scale machine learning on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-pixel">pixel data</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also love making excellent products. I served as technical lead on a cloud-based platform that won a <strong>CI BEST Award</strong> at <a href="https://www.commercialintegrator.com/news/pakedge_unleashes_bakpak_30_cloud_management/"><em>InfoComm 2015</em></a>, the largest pro-AV and systems-integration show in North America. I helped keep Pakedge at the top of the <a href="https://www.cepro.com/network/ce-pro-2018-brand-analysis-home-networking/"><strong>CE Pro Brand Leader</strong></a> list in Home Networking for multiple consecutive years, including 2017 and 2018, when Pakedge led the category among CE Pro 100 integrators.
