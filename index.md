This is Joshua Cole's personal website - my website. 
In my professional life I'm a generalist software engineer with expertise in artificial intelligence, game theory, and machine learning.
I'm currently employed at Amazon where I work on Alexa.
Outside of work I'm a competitive gaming enthusiast and hobbyist writer.
