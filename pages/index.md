## Knowledge

I spent a lot of time learning about learning.
I know a lot about artificial intelligence.
I've studied search, game theory, logical unification, genetic programming, and neural networks.
I'm also a software engineer with more than eight years of experience in the industry.
I used to work at Facebook often making their services better respect your privacy.
Now I'm working at Amazon on Alexa.
I've written about some of what I know.
I hope you find my writing enlightening.
