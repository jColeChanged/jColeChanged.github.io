    <h4>Philosophy</h4>
    <p>
        This site was originally a personal blog and a way to share a little 
        about myself with people who were interested. Most of the content I 
        wrote was about things that I was learning or doing, but I'm not 
        particularly enthused to share my personal details on the internet and 
        producing content mostly focused around things which I'm only just 
        starting to know leads to content which isn't worth reading relative 
        to the wonderful works available elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
        So after a lingering existence in which not much content was produced 
        I switched to a different approach. I tried to use my blogging as a 
        tool for reducing how often I had to repeat myself and as a way to 
        teach about concepts and techniques that I considered valuable. I 
        was much happier with what I produced with this approach to content 
        production.
    </p>
    <p>
        Still this approach had problems. A lot of the concepts and ideas I 
        most wanted to write about and share never ended up getting posted 
        since producing them was hard and I rarely got the work to a point 
        where I felt satisfied sharing it. A big part of this was that I have 
        other things that war for my attention. I write stories online, I 
        compete in the top 1% in video games, and I'm employed as a software / 
        machine learning engineer at a FANG.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, to avoid getting caught in the mire I've been stuck in, this is not 
        a blog. At the risk of sounding melodramatic this is a place where I'm 
        trying to grow and evolve written thought for the purpose of helping 
        myself and others understand the world better and operate within it more 
        effectively.

            <blockquote>
                    I met a traveller from an antique land
                    who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
                    stand in the desert... Near them, on the sand,
                    half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
                    and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
                    tell that its sculptor well those passions read
                    which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
                    the hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
                    and on the pedestal these words appear:
                    'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
                    look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
                    nothing beside remains. Round the decay
                    of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
                    the lone and level sands stretch far away."

                        Ozymandias <br />
                        Percy Bysshe Shelley <br />
                        1792-1822

    <p>
        There will be places where things are not polished. There will be corners 
        that are cut. There will be dead ends and things which are ugly. The plumbing 
        may make itself known to you. This is an open ended attempt at creation and 
        exploration. It is not a finished work.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a consequence of the above this site is not going to be focused on the 
        short term. In the short term things always in flux and changing. Being 
        built up to something greater or at least different than what came before.
        Things like the date of publication should over the course of time become 
        less relevant than the date of the last update.
