      This is Joshua Cole's personal website. I write
      here on software engineering, machine learning, 
      statistics, game theory, and about thinking in 
      general.

    <h1>Later Blog Posts</h1>
    <p>
      These blog posts were written after years working as a professional
      software engineer. In my estimation, they are more worth reading than
      my earlier works.

    <h1>Early Blog Posts</h1>
    <p>
      My early blog posts, published between 2010 and 2014, were about probability,
      statistics, data visualization, software development, artificial intelligence, and machine
      learning. For the most part, they were written while I was learning, rather than after I
      had gained some expertise.
