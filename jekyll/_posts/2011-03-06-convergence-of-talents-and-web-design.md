I recently started reading Edward Tufte's  [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](book). 
In it Tufte spends some time going over the
history of the field. He notes that many charts require both artistic and
statistical ability which are rarely found together. So a lot of the charts
that could have been made in ancient times have only been created in the last
few hundred years as these skills became more commonplace. My reaction to this
was to wonder what would happen when those two abilities would collide with a
third, the ability to program. I didn&rsquo;t have to wait long for an answer.
[chess.com][1], a site which does about what you would
expect, is already giving a a glimpse of the sorts of things you see when
these varied talents work beside each other. Most chess sites have users
select the games they will play by searching through a list of all games.
The list is usually a table which lets you sort by the attributes that you're
interested in.

This site takes a slightly novel approach. In addition to a table they also
offer a graph through which you can select your opponent. The x-axis of the
graph is the length of the game. The y-axis of the graph is the rating at which
the game will be played. Unlike the tabular format you don&rsquo;t need to sort
based on the attribute you're interested in, since everything is already
sorted. Unrated games are distinguished by a white circle.

What strikes me about this convergence is that it has produced something that
is highly intuitive and easy to use. Tufte has emphasized that some of
the better graphic styles are better because they can be understood
intuitively. Meanwhile, many web designers have argued that a good design
doesn&rsquo;t make its users think. This graphic accomplishes the latter by
being the former. When these three talents converge you get both a good
graphic and a good website design.
