I'm going to do this by delving into the realms of game theory including  some of the frontiers which people are still in the process of exploring. This  information can be found elsewhere, but mostly in research papers by brilliant  people like Noam Brown. Not everyone can read those papers and given how little  people talk about these ideas, not many people are reading these papers. While  that is a shame, I'm not going to go about explaining the subject like  they would. I'm going to share it using language that people who enjoy playing  games competitively will be able to easily grasp.</p><p>For most people playing well in a game starts with the realization that you are  terrible at playing games. Which leads the natural question of how  do I not suck at the game I'm playing since I'm definitely going to play video  games all day regardless of what others think I should be doing with my life?  This question has an obvious answer. Get good. Someone might then ask, Joshua,  how is it that I get good? The answer is again obvious. Stop sucking. Out of this  incredibly profound wisdom flows a lot of game theory, which is the mathematics of  complicating the idea that there is such a thing as the best possible thing for you  to do when playing games.</p><p>We're going to start with tic tac toe. You might ask yourself what tic tac toe  has to do with imperfect information games. Knock it off with trying to be smart it is only going to make this incredibly simple concept harder to understand than  it needs to be. Forget you even know that there is a distinction between perfect  information games and imperfect information games, because right now it doesn't  matter.</p><p>We're starting with tic toe for two reasons. </p><p>The first reason we're starting with tic tac toe, because you might actually be  able to play that game pretty well and you're used to playing that game against  people who can presumably not lose. Most imperfect information games aren't like  that so you're brain is going to have absolutely garbage intuition about them built  on top of the fact that a lot of people suck at a lot of things.</p><p>The second reason we're starting with tic tac toe is because there is a simple  concept in multiplayer games that needs to be understood and tic tac toe is actually  really perfect for teaching the concept entirely because you know how to play the  game perfectly.</p><p>In Tic Tac Toe picture you were busy getting draw after draw, because your opponent  has open eyes, is breathing, and even though someone is talking to them they are  still managing to keep one eye on the rather boring game. You're growing frustrated  and you have this clever idea for a way to win. Your opponent always responds  perfectly when you make the right move. Maybe you will throw them off by making a  wrong move!</p><p>If you want to not suck the first thing you need to realize is that you shouldn't be  making decisions under the assumption that your opponent sucks, because if you make  decisions under that assumption your making mistakes and your opponent can now punish  you for the mistakes you make. The trick to playing games well is to not make mistakes  yourself and to punish your opponent for making mistakes without overextending yourself  in the process.</p><p>This is so obvious in the case of Tic Tac Toe, because Tic Tac Toe is a simple game and  you know how to play it perfectly. It is still true in more complicated games like  checkers, chess, League of Legends, Hearthstone, and I'm not going to bother listing any  more games since you are smart enough to get my point. The reason it feels like bad  plays in these games can be good plays isn't because they are good plays, but because  you aren't the only one who sucks at playing games. Your opponents suck too.</p><p>This leads to one of the big insights in game theory which is probably table stakes  for anyone who is actually good at games: when playing games you need to play with the  assumption that your opponents are always going to be making perfect moves. The best  possible moves. Not the moves where they miss something critical. Not the moves where  they are caught by suprise. The best possible moves.</p><p>This is true even in games where there is hidden information. So for exaple, you shouldn't expect that your opponent will suicide into the fountain in  League of Legends just because you don't see them on your screen. You should instead play  as if he is making the best possible decisions, not the worst. In Tennis, when you blink,  you are now in a state of imperfect information. You should not assume that your opponent is  going to stop hitting the ball and start chewing on their racket. This is obvious, but it  doesn't always feel obvious, because sometime people are just really really bad at games. </p><p>Here is where it gets a bit wild. Imperfect information games are actually basically just  perfect information games, but with a twist. In a perfect information game you are making  decisions about what actions you are going to take. In an imperfect information games you  are making decisions about what strategy will be used to select what actions you are going  to take.</p></div></body></html>
