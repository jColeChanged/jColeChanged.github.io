I've discussed in <a href="/2020/03/06/modeling-technical-income.html">Modeling Technical Income</a> how in a short project, best practices are a waste of time, but over a  long project those best practices are a huge time savings. This isn't  unexpected in theory: if we have the same evaluation function and we apply  it to two different datasets we quite obviously have the capacity to get different results.  Yet sometimes, in practice rather than theory, people fail to recognize this  triviality. The time saving optimizations that their mind is taking advantage of  short-circuit the evaluation in situations where knowing one of the datasets is  hard.</p><p>This happens often. It confounds often. Not everyone seems to notice it though. As an example: the Problem of Evil is a logic argument against the existence  of God. It states:</p><p></p><div class="p">   <div class="marginnote"><pre><code>  <p>
    It is making an argument which is claiming that set <code>x</code> is guaranteed to be equal to 
    <code>subset(x)</code>. We can know there is a full <code>x</code> because omniscience is 
    introduced. We know there is a <code>subset(x)</code> because we aren't omniscient. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It declares a guaranteed equality of evaluation function over all possible data subsets of an omniscience 
    entity. Humans evaluate <code>f(subset(x))</code>. The omnscient evaluates <code>f(x)</code>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If <code>f(subset(x)) = f(x)</code> in a general way then subsets are equal to sets. If the problem of evil 
    is a valid argument, then it must be the case that <code>0 = 1</code>. It isn't a valid argument. See 
    further below for a simulation demonstrating that limited information produces the observation of evil even 
    when evil does not exist.
  </p>
</div> </code></pre></div><p></p><blockquote><p> <b>P1.</b> If an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient god exists, then evil does not.<br /> <b>P2.</b> There is evil in the world.<br /> <b>C1.</b> Therefore, an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient god does not exist. </p></blockquote><p>This arguemnt is a great example of how often this confounds people and they  don't recognize it, because a lot of atheists online will argue from observation of  evil that God must not exist.</p><p>Thinking through the implications of being omniscient is, when reasoning about the  evil that we observe in the world, rather hard. A lot of strategic lazinesss has been  applied to not thinking about what omniscience would actually imply. Obviously if we  point to evil, it is evil. Case closed right?</p><p>Not so fast. Literally, don't try to think fast. Your mind is good at being hasty,  but that doesn't mean you are right. It just means you skipped thinking. </p><p>Lets think about this more slowly. Below I've built a simulation. It has two agents. One agent can see one space in front of it. The other is ever so slightly expanded  in terms of what it can see. It can see one additional unit. Observe that despite  sharing the same function for valuing situations, the two agents can disagree as  to what action is good to take. The one space agent will never explore areas in which  there is a negative reward, but the two space agent will do things that the one space  agent considers evil, because it could make better decisions on account of additional  information.</p><p></p><div><pre><code><section class="three-col">

Not only is it not true that omniscience results in a lack of evil, it creates the  conditions for us to observe someone else doing evil when in fact they are doing good.</p><p>This happens well before you get to omniscience. It happens the moment you add even  one more unit of capacity to observe what is happening. </p><p>This should be obvious. If we have the same function, but we apply it to two different  datasets, clearly the result can differ. Each additional unit of information just  increases the likelihood of divergence. </p><p>I've taken to calling this error the horizon effect, because when I see it  happen it appears to happen on account of people having an information frontier  which they haven't explored. They don't recognize that the dataset they evaluate  isn't actually the only dataset present. They don't extend their thinking beyond  the horizon, but keep it fixed on what is near at hand.</p><p>It makes sense that people do this. </p><p>We have a limit to how much time we have. We have to use that time wisely. As a consequence, strategic  laziness is essential. Real wisdom recommends diligence, but insight tells us that strategic laziness  and strategic dilligence are the same thing: a choice about where to apply our time in order to be  effective. So people do it and sometimes they make the inevitable mistakes.</p><p>We can't explore every frontier. We can't push every horizon outward. We simply don't have  the time to do so.</p><p>If just one step of additional information is enough to cause differing evaluation functions, it is quite obvious that extending it an infinte amount  opens up the opportunity to even more divergence.</p><p>If you are Christian in particular and you don't think the Problem of Evil or Good and Evil are about hidden information, please notice that the first thing which happens after gaining knowledge of good and evil is the introduction of the concept of the hiding of information through the wearing of clothes. I'm not deeply twisting what evil is when I talk about in terms of subjective evaluation functions and hidden information.</p><p>If you are a die hard atheist who really liked this argument and wants to double down by pointing to areas in which you are very confident that <code>f(subset(x)) = f(x)</code> because of the use inference rather than argument from deductive logic: I'm a creator of artificial intelligence. I very intentionally create hidden information when building machines which learn. I also set up systems which are intentionally challenged and stressed so that they can get better over time. When you argue against the existent of a Creator from inference you argue against my own existence. You're asking me to believe that I don't exist and the root claim of your argument is that I don't exist because you have limited information. Your strong case is built atop the assumption that what you consider evil, is, but a faithful creator can intentionally create evil, because they are faithful.</p><p>Want to hear something even more insane? I use Python to do it. A snake, if you will, is my tool for doing this. It is like we're living in a simulation in which a  creator intentionally moved things to this point so as to make the point in a way that you could more easily understand.</p><p>I create metrics by which agents are evaluated then I very intentionally set out to find the areas in which those metrics are not properly maximized toward good with full intention to get them to be good. An algorithm that experiences itself temporally would, over small time periods, conclude that I am evil because I subject it to evil experience which point out the minimization of those metrics. Yet nevertheless the end result given a larger time bound creates the condition that the evaluation of what I did maximized, not minimized, but maximized the metric.</p><p>It isn't actually good for a species to not be challenged. The tree that isn't tested by the wind doesn't know to strengthen itself so as to be robust to the wind. Your misguided notion of what creation ought to look like goes against good system design principles. Netflix, for example, intentionally causes downtime in their systems by breaking things. They do this, not to go down, but to stay up. On account of doing this they ended up staying up where others fell. You've confused <code>f(x) = f(subset(x))</code> being true with the rest of the argument being true. The argument is not sound. The claim that evil can't exist if omniscience exists is false. There is no relationship. Does food become healthy when it is junk food because you like the taste of it? Yes, says the person who doubles down, because in every case I really like the taste of junk food and so from inference I can tell that even though there is no logical argument that proves that my evaluation function is correct I insist upon my evaluation function on the basis of the surplus of evidence. Those who like the non-junk food are evil, they minimize pleasure. Yet who really minimized pleasure when the eat of junk food is in subtle pain while the eater of healthy food is thriving? I use this example, because I get the impression that some atheists are terribly conceited and think everyone else is actually secretly idiotic and just trying to rationalize rather than trying to think clearly, but in the case of junk food even they can realize that sometimes short term thinking isn't good long term thinking.</p><p><style><pre><code>.three-col {

As a consequence, prefer learning to judgement. This logic extends  especially unto God who knows more then all. The fall out of this would seem  to be that a person should prefer gaining more information in order to make  better decisions. Also worth noting is that the two space agent who knows more  can prefer longer paths and have worse then one-move only average short-terms  despite being logically greater in the long-term.</p><p><script id="horizonSimulation" type="text/javascript"> {% include horizons/simulation.js %} </script></p><p></p><div id="fn-code"> <a href="#visualization">Jump back to visualization.</a> The code to generate the visualization: <div id="horizonSimulationView"></div> <a href="#visualization">Jump back to visualization.</a> </div><p></p></div></div></body></html>
