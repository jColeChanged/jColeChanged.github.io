The plugin was called findfn, because that is what it did. When someone types something in IRC along the lines of <code>findfn 2 2 4</code> it would return a list of all the functions which would return <code>4</code> after being passed <code>2</code> twice. In that example it would probably return the operators for both addition and multiplication. Other times it might return first, last, map, or any number of other functions.</p><p>To do this the plugin took a brute force approach. There weren’t any clever means of figuring out what would return what, though it would be probably be possible to do that given functions with the right metadata. Instead it went through all the functions in the core namespaces and tested each of them to see if applying all but the last argument would return a result which matched the last argument.</p><p>It wasn’t long after that I submitted the plugin that I saw it being rolled out in #clojure. Then only a little while after that I saw the plugin being merged into the core of the bot. For a first time contribution to open source I was pretty happy with the result. People actually found something I had helped to build to be useful.</p><p>I’m really glad that I had the chance to give back to the IRC community in #clojure. For those of you who program in Clojure, but haven’t been there, you’re really missing out. It is home to some of the nicest and most helpful people I’ve met online. I’m pretty sure that I ended up having more questions answered in the IRC chat and through searching its logs then I did on [StackOverflow][1].</p><p>I know that I would never have submitted the plugin if it weren’t for wonderful people like amalloy and raynes. amalloy helped me fix a bug in the initial impementation of the function and also guided me through submitting the plugin to lazybot.</p><p>[1]: http://www.stackoverflow.com/</p></div></body></html>
