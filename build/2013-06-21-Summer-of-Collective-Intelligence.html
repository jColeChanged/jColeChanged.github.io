The book covers a variety of machine learning algorithms that can be used to build recommendation systems and search engines, among  other things. Our plan was to get through two chapters each week and then cap each week off with a Google Hangout session in which we shared what  we learned.</p><p>I decided not just share this with the study group, but with anyone who wanted to  read about my learning on my blog. I figured that it will both help me learn the material and also allow me to better see my progress.</p><h1>A Recommendation System</h1><p>The second chapter is all about building recommendation systems similar in function to the systems that give recommendations to Netflix viewers, Amazon shoppers, and last.fm listeners. The approach that these systems take is rooted in trying to recommend items that people who were similar to you also liked. The real world logic goes something like this: Usually when someone recommends something they like, another person will like it if they like similar things. So a good way to find good recommendations would be to find users who are similar in their preferences to whoever is getting the recommendation.</p><p>This broke the problem down into two parts. The first part was coming up with a way to see how similar users were. The second part was using those similar users to generate recommendations.</p><p>The first part of that problem can be broken down even further. The first step is to define a distance function. Then the following step is merely sorting users by the distance function to find out who is 'close' in the preference space to the person who is getting recommendations.</p><p>There are a lot of distance functions. You can treat ratings as points and see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance">how far from each other they are in euclidean space</a>. You can treat ratings as a dataset and then measure similarity by looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient">the strength of their linear dependence</a>. You can even treat ratings as an admission of having seen something and then have the measure of <a href="http://www.quora.com/Machine-Learning/What-is-Tanimoto-Score-and-when-is-it-used">distance be the proportion of items that both parties saw to how many either saw</a>. There are plenty of other distance metrics. The tricky bit is deciding which ones makes the most sense to use.</p><p>From there the next thing that was needed was to use the most similar users to generate recommendations. A na√Øve approach would be to take the most similar user and recommend something from them, but if you think about this approach has a drawback. It throws away the opinions of the other people who had good taste. A smarter approach is to factor in their opinions. To do this the author recommends items by the weighted average of their ratings where the weight is similarity between the user who gave the rating and the user receiving the recommendation.</p><p></p><pre><code><caption>An example of creating weights</caption>
<tr>
  <th>Similarity</th>
  <th>Rating</th>
  <th>Weighted Rating</th>
</tr> </code></pre><pre><code><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>.5</td><td>1</td><td>.5</td></tr>
<tr><th>Average Similarity</th><th>Average Rating</th><th>Average Weighed Rating</th></tr>
<tr><td>.75</td><td>1</td><td>.75</td></tr> </code></pre><table class="table">   <thead>  </thead>   <tbody>  </tbody> </table><p></p><p>Of course once you have the weighted average there is still one gotcha. What if some movies got more reviews then others? This can be solved by making sure that you then proceed to adjust the weighted average by the sum of the similarity.</p><h1>Things I Built</h1><p>While working through this chapter and its example code I built:</p><ul><li>A movie recommendation system built on top of the MovieLens movie dataset.</li><li>A bookmark recommendation system built on top of the Delicious API.</li><li>A music recommendation system built on top of the last.fm API.</li></ul><h1>A Contribution To An Open Source Project</h1><p>While working through this project I developed a patch for pydelicious. I found a bug in the pydelicious source and sent a fix upstream.</p><p>[book]: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596529325/ref=as<i>li</i>tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joshuacoles-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0596529325&linkId=6e48c22fa422df9f35994c4acd00ac10</p></div></body></html>
