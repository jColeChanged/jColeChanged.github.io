<html max-width="800"><div><h1>A Little Bit Irrational</h1><p>Published at: </p><p>Tags: </p><br /><div><p>My uncle Tim asked me to run a card game at the local bowling alley.  People bought into the game for $1. The buy-in went into the pot. If nobody won the pot would carry over to the next week.  The carry over would continue until someone did manage to win.  In order to win you had to draw a specially marked card from a deck of five-hundred cards.</p><p>With five hundred cards the probability of drawing the winning card was </p><p>$$\frac{1}{500}$$</p><p>When I did the math, I realized that getting into the card game didn't make much sense.  When I broke things down I found that there was roughly a 1% chance of winning the game.  I knew that I could use that information to calculate the average amount which will be won.</p><p><code>average<i>win = chance</i>to<i>win * pot</i>size</code></p><p>Of course, knowing how much I was expected to win isn't enough to know if the game is worth playing. I also factor in how much I had to pay to have a chance at winning the money. The expected return on each game is actually our chance to win multiplied by the pot size minus the amount we payed to get into the game.</p><p><code>average<i>return = win</i>chance * pot - buy_in</code></p><p>So what happens when we plug in our 1% chance to win, our $1 opportunity cost, and graph the result?</p><p></p><figure><pre><code><img src="/img/a-little-bit-irrational/average-return.png" alt="Average Returns" /> </code></pre></figure><p></p><p>Basically, unless the pot has more then a hundred dollars in it, we are going in expecting to lose money. So since there is no guarantee that we will stay in every week, it doesn't make sense to get into the game. Though I suppose people could get non-monetary returns, like social opportunity, which might overwhelm the trivial pot sizes.</p></div></div></html>
